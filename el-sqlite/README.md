# Electron Sqlite Setup
This setup presents a basic integration with sqlite. It includes some popular building tools. This example shows how to interact with an sqlite db in development and in production. The Jquery examples are knowingly messy and not written well, but serve as examples for basic ipc communication with database calls included. The example includes initializing a sqlite db with an sql file read by node and executed by node-sqlite3.
